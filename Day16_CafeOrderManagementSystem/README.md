Cafe Order Management Summary
This C program helps a cafe quickly handle orders for several customers.
It asks each customer what items they want from the menu, takes their order quantities, checks for mistakes, and calculates the bill.
After serving all customers, it gives a summary: total revenue, total items sold, and which item was bought the most and the least.
The logic is simple and structured with loops, easy checks, and keeps everything organized.
